---------- Numerical methods project 2017-2018 --------------

# Author : Denis Verstraeten

The aim of this project is to solve iteratively a linear problem corresponding to a stationary heat conduction equation. First it implements the differential problem as a linear system of equations. Then the multigrain method, and finally the conjugate gradient method.
