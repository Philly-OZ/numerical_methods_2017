------- Basic steps for the project -----------

1 - Implement the matrix A using the code provided last year
2 - Implement a math module
	- To assess the spectral radius of a matrix
	- To multiply matrix
	- To compute matrix/vector norms
3 - Implement the two grid method
4 - Implement a ui to see solutions
5 - Implement geometric multi-grid method 
	a - Choose what type of multi-grid use (V or W, why one instead of the other ?)
	b - Implement the method based on the two grid method applied recursively
		i - Code a condition checking how deep to go in the coarser grids : stop 		when either the matrix is 1X1 or solving the matrix is less costly than
		applying the coarser grid transformation
	c - Study the convergence by assessing the spectral radius
6 - Implement a conjugate gradient method
	a - Check convergence improvement based on the # of iterations needed to solve the 	problem compared to a mere multi-grid method
	b - Compare those results to theoretical bounds on the # of iterations
